## Kevin
### is:
* single dad of 3 daughters and 2 sons, with 3 in university and 2 at home.  I grew up in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia
* blessed to have a high school math teacher who challenged me to master an Apple ][+
* blunt, direct, and often too open
* a minimalist
  * write as little code as possible
  * institute as little process as possible
  * have as few managers (but as many leaders) as possible

### isNot
* always considerate of different learning styles
  * I sometimes intimidate folks who prefer less bluntness
* (seeminlgy) strongly structured
  * raising 5 kids is not possible with direct control or OCD
* good at setting context
  * I often rely on instinct and don't always recognize that others are confused or uncertain

## Feedback
### is:
* streamed
* sometimes given in a group setting
* bidirectional
  * we will work together to help you feel comfortable to give me feedback in a style that works for you
  * I will strive to learn to listen to you

### isNot
* reserved for 1:1 and/or review

* transactional; sometimes you will adapt to feedbac

## Management
### is
* execution
  * transparently deliver product and execute on my commitments
* hiring
  * bring in great folks
* helping you
  * align the needs and direction of the team with your needs, and vice versa
* balancing speed with correctness

### isNot
* giving orders
  * sometimes, speed requires it, but there's usually better ways
* creating process
* attending meetings
  * while I do, I endeavor to be on the floor as much as possible
* filling out paperwork

## Communication
* Slack/email/text me anytime, I will respond within an hour
* My kids come first
  * If you see me on my phone in a meeting or while talking with you, it is because one of my kids needs something

## 1:1
### is
* your time, your agenda; I will help you develop that skill
* a balance of looking at short term and long term goals
* documented; let's keep track of what we share
* a time to share our global state; I will often ask you how you feel about things on a scale of 1-10

### is not:
* a status check
* (necessarily) friend time
* the primary vehicle for feedback
